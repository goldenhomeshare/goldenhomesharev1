# Project Brief: Golden HomeShare (MVP)

## 1. Introduction
This document serves as the foundational project brief for the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) of **Golden HomeShare**. It defines the core requirements, goals, and scope for building a tech-enabled platform connecting older adult homeowners with vetted housemates for mutual benefit through home-sharing. This document is the source of truth for the project's direction and scope.

## 2. Mission
Empower older homeowners to age in place with dignity, community, and financial independenceâ€”by turning underutilized space into safe, sustainable living arrangements.

## 3. Core Concept
At its core, Golden HomeShare is a **home-sharing marketplace** where:

- **Older adults (homeowners)** list spare rooms.
- **Housemates** (often younger renters) apply to live there.
- In return for **discounted rent**, housemates agree to provide **light household support** (e.g., errands, tech help, cleaning).

Think of it as a blend of:
- **Airbnb** (room listing + booking interface),
- **TaskRabbit** (light tasks as part of the value exchange), and
- **Match.com** (compatibility + safety are key).

## 4. Goals (MVP)
- **Empower Homeowners:** Provide older adults with a secure and easy-to-use platform to monetize underutilized space in their homes.
- **Facilitate Affordable Housing:** Offer housemates a cost-effective housing option in exchange for providing light assistance.
- **Build Community:** Foster mutually beneficial relationships between homeowners and housemates.
- **Ensure Safety and Trust:** Implement features that prioritize the safety and security of both parties.
- **Establish a Scalable Platform:** Build a flexible web application capable of supporting future growth and feature expansion.
